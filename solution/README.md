### General Notes

* Thank you.
* Both the `scrape.py` and `normalize.py` scripts were written using Python 3.7.

### Scraping Exercise

* First, start the [Flask application](https://github.com/anthonydb/data-take-home/tree/master/edgar) included in this repo.
* Create a separate Python 3.7 virtual environment and `cd` to the `\solution\edgar\` directory.
* Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to obtain the dependencies.
* You can then run the scraper with `python scrape.py`

### CSV Exercise

* Create a Python 3.7 virtual environment and `cd` to the `\solution\csv\` directory.
* Run the script with `python normalize.py`
