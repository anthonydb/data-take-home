# Data Take Home Exercises

Thank you for taking the time to attempt these exercises. We're sincerely thankful for your time in attempting these.  We estimate depending on your skill level these exercises to take between 1 to 2.5 hours. If you find yourself taking more than 2 hours, you may be over-engineering the solution, consider taking an easier option.

## Instructions

Please create a fork of this repository. Create a folder named `solution` and place your responses here. When ready please notify your coordinator to take a look.

### Structure

* [`edgar`](edgar) - A company listings site. See [`edgar/README.md`](edgar/README.md) for instructions on how to run the local server.
* [`files`](files) - CSV files

## Tasks

### Scrape the companies

Write a script to scrape a sample site and output its data in JSON.

`edgar` is a company listings site containing ten pages of company links. Each link endpoint holds company-specific data such  as name, description and address. The sole requirement of this part of the test is to produce JSON of all of the company listings data for the site.

_Please commit an `edgar.json` file of the parsed company listings data along with your solution code in the `solution/edgar` folder. Include a `requirements.txt` file if necessary._

#### Recommended libraries: 

* [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) contains a robust HTML parser.
* Python's standard [`json`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/json.html) module is convenient for working with the [JSON](http://json.org) format. 

### Normalize the data

Write a script to transform input CSV to desired output CSV. 

You will find a CSV file in the `files` folder named [`data.csv`](files/data.csv). There are two steps (plus an optional bonus - Date offset) to this part of the test. Each step concerns manipulating the values for a single field according to the step's requirements. The steps are as follows:

**String cleaning** - The `bio` field contains text with arbitrary padding, spacing and line breaks. Normalize these values to a space-delimited string.

**Code swap** - There is a supplementary CSV in the `files` folder named [`state_abbreviations.csv`](files/state_abbreviations.csv). This "data dictionary" contains state abbreviations alongside state names. For the state field of the input CSV, replace each state abbreviation with its associated state name from the data dictionary.

**Date offset** (_Optional_) - The `start_date` field contains data in a variety of formats. These may include e.g., `June 23, 1912` or `5/11/1930` (month, day, year). But not all values are valid dates. Invalid dates may include e.g., `June 2018`, `3/06` (incomplete dates), or even arbitrary natural language. Add a `start_date_description` field adjacent to the `start_date` column to filter invalid date values into. Normalize all valid date values in `start_date` to ISO 8601 (i.e., `YYYY-MM-DD`).

Your script should take [`data.csv`](files/data.csv) as input and produce a cleaned `enriched.csv` file according to the step requirements above. 

_Please commit an `enriched.csv` file along with your solution code in the `solution/csv` folder._

#### Recommended libraries:

* Python's standard [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/csv.html) module is standard for dealing with CSV data.

## Submission Guidelines

We ask that your solutions be implemented in Python. If you are coming from a different language or if your Python is rusty, we've linked to a few Python reference resources (in order of length/detail) below to help!

* [LPTHW](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) - slow-build introduction to basic programming in Python.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/) - crash course on Python syntax and data types.
* [learn x in y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) - quick Python reference and run-through.

_Anything specified as "optional" or "bonus" is just that, and you will not be penalized for its exclusion._

We suggest submission of these materials within 2 business days.
